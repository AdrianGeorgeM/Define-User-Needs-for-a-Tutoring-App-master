Create a mockup for a client Identify functional application requirements based on client needs Manage a code project using agile methodology Model a technical solution for a client using domain models

Use case diagrams for each of the major functionalities of each page (connection, chat, calendar, task manager, dashboard) - no need to use UML.
User stories with acceptance criteria for each feature, shared in a standard format (PDF, DOCX, XLSX).
Mockups of the site, with a basic design and at least one mockup per page (you can use Figma or Sketch for that).
A kanban dividing the project in a macro way (technical details excluded) into blocks of functionalities and sub-functionalities for development. I started the breakdown in this kanban on Notion. You should complete the "ANALYZE" column. (Feel free to work on Notion, Trello, or GitHub.)
